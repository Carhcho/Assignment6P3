Math functions
<br>
the power function takes the base number called number and multiplies recursively the base number to another base number until the powerNumber reaches 0 hence doing 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 and the powerNumber 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0
<br>
the reverser function creates a substring from position 1 to the length of the phrase string plus the position of a character within the string with the at function at position 0 recursively repeating it changing the orientation of the string.
<br>
the sum function returns the sumNumber (in my example 6) and then sums recursively the sumNumber minus 1 (so 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1) and when it reaches 1 it returns the total sum.
